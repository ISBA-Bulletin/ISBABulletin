#### New j-ISBA Board Members

With the start of 2025, the newly elected officers have joined the j-ISBA Board. Please join me in welcoming our new Chair-Elect, Francesca Panero, and our new Treasurer, Alessandro Zito. You can find their brief biographies on the j-ISBA website at this [link](https://j-isba.github.io/officers.html). 

A big "thank you'' goes to our outgoing Board Members Beatrice Franzolini and Beniamino Hadj-Amar for their hard work and outstanding service to j-ISBA in 2023 and 2024!

j-ISBA will hold elections again this year for the positions of Chair-Elect, Program Chair and Secretary; announcements will follow in the upcoming months.

#### Upcoming events and ongoing activities.

- [BaYSM 2025](https://baysm2025.github.io), the official annual conference of j-ISBA, will take place online on April 7-11, 2025. It will offer a great and accessible platform for young researchers from all over the world to share their work and engage with peers and established professors in the Bayesian community. We have received a stellar collection of abstracts and we cannot wait to hear more about these research works in oral presentations and short talks. We are also delighted to have five plenary speakers: Samuel Livingstone (University College London), Julia Palacios (Stanford University), Fernando Quintana (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile), Surya Tokdar (Duke University) and Stéphanie van der Pas (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam).

  Registration is only $5 for all j-ISBA members, so don’t forget to renew your membership!

- The 2025 edition of the [Blackwell-Rosenbluth Award](https://j-isba.github.io/blackwell-rosenbluth.html) is upcoming! The award aims at recognizing outstanding junior Bayesian researchers, based on their overall contributions to the field and
to the community. While the call will open in April 2025, you might start thinking about a
nomination! PhD students or early career researchers who obtained their PhD after January 1, 2020 will be eligible. 

- The j-ISBA [Peer mentoring Scheme](https://j-isba.github.io/peer-mentoring.html) offers a platform for you to be paired online with another young researcher in the field, providing a friendly and secure place to seek support and guidance. Peer mentors are j-ISBA members who have volunteered to join the program. Based on their experiences, they will be able to offer you advice on how to navigate the uncertainties and difficulties that may arise during your early years in research.

  Accessing peer mentoring is extremely simple! Just look through the list of available peer mentors [here](https://j-isba.github.io/peer-mentoring.html) for the one that may best match your needs, and contact them via email to ask to schedule a first virtual meeting.
