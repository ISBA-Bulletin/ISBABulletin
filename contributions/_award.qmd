The ISBA Prize Committee and sub-committees have carried out the difficult task of identifying winners and honorable mentions from several nominations for the Savage Award and The Mitchell Prize. This August, the ISBA Awards Ceremony will take place at the ASA SBSS reception in the Joint Statistical Meeting, which will be held in Nashville, USA, during August 2–7, 2025. In this issue, we celebrate the Savage Finalists as well as the 2025 Calls for the Savage Award, the DeGroot Prize, and the Mitchell Prize. 

#### Savage 2024 Award Finalists

In the category of **Applied Methodology**, the three finalists (in alphabetical order of their last name) are: **Nicholas Marco** for the thesis "Mixed Membership Models with Applications to Neuroimaging" (Supervisors: Donatello Telesca); **Mélodie Monod** for the thesis "Bayesian Models and Methods to Estimate Age-specific Infectious Disease Transmission Dynamics: Integrating Disease Surveillance Time Series, Mobility, and Vaccination data" (Supervisors:  Oliver Ratmann and Samir Bhatt); and **Alessandro Zito** for the thesis "Ecological Modeling via Bayesian Nonparametric Species Sampling Prior" (Supervisor: David Dunson). 

In the category of **Theory and Methods**, the two finalists (in alphabetical order of their last name) are: **María Fernanda Gil-Leyva** for the thesis "Stick-breaking processes and related random probability measures" (Supervisor: Ramsés H. Mena); and **Takuo Matsubara** for the thesis "Bridging the gap between modelling and computation in Bayesian statistics" (Supervisor: Chris Oates).

The Savage Award 2024 sub-committees comprised Veronica Berrocal (Chair), Roberta De Vito, Dani Gamerman, Clara Grazian, Andrew Holbrook, Juhee Lee, and Andrew Zammit-Mangion, for the category of Applied Methodology; and Marta Catalano, 
Peter Hoff, Jaeyong Lee (Chair), Kyungjae Lee, Feng Liang, Depdeep Pati, and Yanxun Xu, for the category of Theory and Methods. The Prize Committee is grateful for the timely and thorough review carried out by both sub-committees.  

The Savage finalists’ presentations have been scheduled on Monday, August 4, 2025, 10:30 AM - 12:20 PM at the Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM), to be held in Nashville, USA. You are invited to attend, and we hope to see many of you there!
