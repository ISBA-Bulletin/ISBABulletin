Welcome to the first ISBA Bulletin in 2025! This is my first message to the Bayesian community from this column. As Aad van der Vaart transitions from President to Past President, we extend our sincere thanks for his exemplary service. We also salute Amy Herring as she steps down from the Executive Council after three outstanding years, and we warmly welcome Antonio Lijoi as President-Elect.

I start my term as President during interesting and rapidly changing times. ISBA is not a political organization, but we are not immune to political and economic changes. Restrictions on conference participation, evolving funding environments, and shifting visa policies have real implications. These challenges shape how we connect, collaborate, and continue our mission.

#### The hallmarks of ISBA

In moments like these, it is especially important to pause and reflect on ISBA, our mission and why it matters. **ISBA is more than just a professional affiliation**; it is a supportive and dynamic community dedicated to promoting Bayesian analysis worldwide and fostering the next generation of researchers. Recently, I reached out to the **leaders of ISBA’s Sections** to gather their perspectives on **what ISBA means to them**. The responses consistently described our society as a space where important connections are formed - both socially and scientifically - through our conferences, section activities, and other initiatives. ISBA is seen as a space where we can keep pace with developments across the Bayesian landscape, and where junior researchers can easily engage with senior colleagues. This doesn't come without effort. **ISBA invests heavily in supporting students and early-career researchers**. For the 2024 World Meeting in Venice, ISBA allocated around $85,000 in combined society and sponsor funds for young travel support. Individual Sections also provide substantial funding for student participation in their meetings. Membership fees remain highly accessible - just \$5 per year for students.

**ISBA also sponsors several awards**. A full list is available [here](https://bayesian.org/membership/awards/). Among them, the most prominent is the Savage Award, presented annually to recognize two outstanding doctoral dissertations in Bayesian econometrics and statistics. The finalists for the 2024 Savage Award are featured in the [Awards Section](#sec-awards) of this bulletin. In addition, calls for nominations for the 2025 DeGroot Prize, Mitchell Prize, and Savage Award are now open, with submissions due by May 31, 2025. Many thanks to the ISBA Prize Committee and its subcommittees for their work on the selection process.

ISBA also publishes and financially supports **_Bayesian Analysis_**, now consistently ranked among the top journals in statistics and probability. For recent updates and future directions, see the [section on _Bayesian Analysis_ in this bulletin](#sec-ba) by its new Editor-in-Chief, Igor Prünster. Many thanks to the editorial board of the journal for their continued dedication and service.

In addition to conferences - where members receive discounted registration - many ISBA sections offer **publicly accessible webinars**. Recordings of these events are often available on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/ISBAInternationalSocietyofBayesianAnalysis), which now features over 150 videos and more than 1,320 subscribers.

#### The future: Challenges and Opportunities

Looking ahead, we need to think about how to meet the challenges before us. In my brief survey of Section leaders, many expressed a desire for ISBA to offer **new ways to foster collaborations**. Suggestions included a more visible social media presence, more virtual events - such as onboarding sessions for new members, webinars, and online reading groups organized around shared research interests - and informal structures to encourage cross-Section engagement. There was also interest in seeing ISBA take a stronger role in **connecting academia and industry**, by highlighting real-world applications of Bayesian methods and encouraging participation from practitioners outside academic settings.

Following this input, for the first time ever, as an experiment to foster connections with industry and  members, ISBA and the Section on Bayesian Statistical Science (SBSS) of the American Statistical Association are exploring the possibility to host a **joint community table** in the exhibit hall of the [2025 Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM)](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2025/), taking place August 2--7 in Nashville, TN. 
	
At a broader level, it's going to be very important to **expand ISBA’s geographical presence**. Our Asian Chapter is a strong example of successful regional growth, that has lead to a now annual conference. I encourage participation to this important event. The next meeting will be held on July, 4-5, 2025, at Kyungpook National University, in South Korea. It will also be important to seize opportunities to strengthen our presence in Australia and Southeast Asia.  Latin America has an active participation, and continued support is essential to help overcome resource limitations. Africa also presents significant potential, and ISBA should explore ways to increase engagement and provide support in this and other regions where financial and institutional barriers remain high.


It’s also important to **broaden ISBA’s outreach**. We should aim to be a home for all  users of Bayesian methods  - not just statisticians, but also Bayesians in machine learning, cognitive science, psychology, ecology, economics, and the social sciences. I believe that the proposed **Bayesian Social Sciences Section** is a significant step in that direction. A petition for a **Bayesian Deep Learning** Section is also in the making. These activities show our commitment to creating a home for all communities applying Bayesian tools to complex, real-world problems.


This is not just about outreach - I believe it is vital to the future of ISBA. To be relevant, ISBA must remain open, outward-facing, and deeply connected to the broader scientific communities we aim to serve. Interestingly, see [what Philip Dawid wrote](https://bayesian.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/0003.pdf) in this same column as President of ISBA in 2000. Incidentally, that bulletin issue is, in my opinion, a little gem. 


#### Recognizing pioneers

**In this issue, we honor the lives and legacies of two important figures for our community:** [Herman van Dijk](#sec-obit1) and [John Deely](#sec-obit2).  Herman van Dijk made foundational contributions to Bayesian econometrics and helped shape how Bayesian methods are applied to macroeconomic and financial modeling. John Deely has made contributions  in many  areas including engineering,  biological sciences, agriculture and business. He was known for his humor, real-world examples, and ability to make statistics both accessible and compelling.  Both Herman van Dijk and John Deely embodied **a vision of Bayesian analysis that goes beyond disciplinary boundaries** - precisely the spirit ISBA strives to cultivate.

As we were putting the finishing touches on this issue, we learned also the sad news of Martin A. Tanner's recent passing. He made remarkable contributions to Bayesian computation and public health, and was a recipient of the prestigious Mortimer Spiegelman Award. For an obituary see [here](https://statistics.northwestern.edu/people/in-memoriam/martin-tanner.html).

#### Conferences: Innovation and Tradition

Conferences are central to ISBA's mission, fostering collaboration and exchange within the Bayesian community. To address evolving global challenges, ISBA is forming a committee to explore **innovative conference formats**, including "hub meetings." These involve regional in-person gatherings interconnected via digital platforms, allowing participants to engage locally and globally. This model aims to mitigate environmental impact, reduce costs, and improve accessibility.
The success of virtual events like the **Bayesian Young Statisticians Meeting (BAYSM)** also demonstrates the viability of such approaches. For instance, [BAYSM 2025](https://baysm2025.github.io/), scheduled for April 7-11, 2025, will be fully online, providing a platform for early-career Bayesian researchers to connect and share their work.  By integrating traditional in-person meetings like our flagship World Meeting with hub and virtual conferences,  ISBA may be able to adapt to changing circumstances while maintaining a vibrant, inclusive community.


On that note, I’d like to remind you of the call for invited sessions for the **[2026 ISBA World Meeting](https://isba2026.github.io/)**, which will take place from June 28 to July 3, 2026, in Nagoya, Japan. Please see the [updates from the Program Council](#sec-pc) later in this bulletin for more details.

We also have a number of **Section meetings** planned for this year - for example, **[O'Bayes 2025](https://obayes25.aueb.gr/)**, **[Bayes Comp 2025](https://bayescomp2025.sg/)**, **[BNP 14](https://bnp14.org/)**, and the first meeting of the Bayesian BioPharm Section, **[BBP 2025](https://bnp14.org/bbp2025/)** - all taking place in June 2025. EnviBayes is also exploring the possibility of a meeting later this year. For more details on conferences around the world, check out the [_News from the World_](#sec-pc) section of the bulletin, thoughtfully curated by Déborah Sulem.





#### Thanking those that keep ISBA running 

Finally, I’d like to express my sincere thanks to those who play essential roles behind the scenes  in ISBA. Many in our community deserve recognition for their dedicated service - including the Board of Directors, the Program Council, Section leaders, members of ISBA’s various committees, our Treasurer Yanxun Xu, our Secretary Xinyi Xu, and our Administrative Assistant Colleen Martin. ISBA would not be what it is without such committed and dedicated members. 

Today, I would like to give a special thanks to the editorial board of the ISBA Bulletin for their continued work in shaping and curating its content. In particular, I want to acknowledge Francesco Denti for his creative redesign, which has brought a fresh and engaging look to our publication. He also had to endure my many last-minute changes to the versions of the column you are reading.

I’m also grateful to our social media team - Julyan Arbel, Andrew Brown, Clara Grazian, and Staci Helper - for their dedication to expanding ISBA’s visibility and reach. A special thanks to Andrew Brown as well for his work as web editor.

Please consider following and engaging with ISBA on [BlueSky](https://web-cdn.bsky.app/profile/did:plc:rrp2xprohkn3vz57e5a2jeag) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/isba-international-society-of-bayesian-analysis). As always, I encourage you to share news, achievements, and initiatives from your departments and institutions. This kind of collective sharing and mutual support helps keep our community strong and connected - especially in times full of external challenges as the one we are living in.

Last but not least, I would like to remind you to **renew your ISBA membership** or, even better, to become a **lifetime member**! A large membership base is essential to allow ISBA to foster an international community interested in Bayesian analysis and its applications.
