Professor John Joseph Deely, 92, was born in Cleveland, Ohio on January 13, 1933 and died on January 17, 2025. He earned an Electrical Engineering degree from Georgia Tech before pursuing his passion for mathematics and statistics at Purdue University, where he completed his M.S. in Mathematics in 1958 and a Ph.D. in Statistics in 1965 under the supervision of Professor Shanti S. Gupta, with thesis title “Multiple Decision Procedures from an Empirical Bayes Approach.” John’s career took him from Sandia Corporation in Albuquerque, where he worked on space age technology, to the University of Canterbury in New Zealand in 1968, where he spent 28 years growing the statistics program and mentoring generations of students. Under his leadership, the program expanded from a single course with 100 students to a thriving department with eight courses and hundreds of students. In recognition of his contributions, he was promoted rapidly to Professor in 1972, ultimately serving as Chair of Statistics.

In 1997, John returned to Purdue, where he became a much-admired Continuing Lecturer, primarily teaching STAT 113: Statistics and Society. With his sharp wit and engaging teaching style, he introduced thousands of students to the power of statistical reasoning. In his words, "They hate numbers. They hate data. The challenge is can you somehow give such students a little appreciation in statistical reasoning in spite of their hatred of numbers. Can you make it interesting enough? I'm always looking for funny ways, ways in which people abuse statistics." He was known for his humor, real-world examples, and ability to make statistics both accessible and compelling. In 2004, he won the David S. Moore Service Teaching Award. Beyond the classroom, he remained an active researcher, collaborating with colleagues worldwide on Hierarchical Bayesian methods, Bayes empirical Bayes, Bayesian ranking and selection and statistical decision theory. John was named Fellow of the American Statistical Association in 2007. 2007, with the citation reading "For outstanding research on empirical Bayes, ranking and selection, and Bayesian statistics; and for exemplary consulting work." Within ISBA he was also beloved, along with Ed George, for their hilarious administration of the Deely awards at various Bayesian conferences.
John was able to invite a number of distinguished Bayesian statisticians to the University of Canterbury as Erskine Fellows for durations of 1-3 months, resulting in collaborations and friendships that endured throughout his life. A two-day conference was held on July 5-6, 2007 at the University of Canterbury, honoring his contributions both to the field of Statistics, and to the lives of all those he touched throughout his career. He retired at the remarkable age of 85.
 
John was sustained by his mutual and indefatigable love affair with Elizabeth "Ann" Young, his wife of 35 years. He is also survived by his six children, eight grandchildren, two great-grandchildren, two stepchildren, and two step-grandchildren. He found true joy in the life he built with Ann and he gave joy to those who were lucky enough to be his friend. May John's memory bring comfort to all who knew him and inspire future generations in the pursuit of knowledge.
As Gary MacDonald quoted in his eulogy for Shanti Gupta, “Death ends a life but not a relationship”. John’s memory will live through the many close relationships he established with friends and colleagues all over the world.
